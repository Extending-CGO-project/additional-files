# This repository contains all files relevant to the extention of the Common Greenhouse Ontology (CGO) in OWL.

This repository is structured as follow:

- `./owl`: folder containing the definition files of XXXXX.
- `./prototype`: folder containing files to simulate the implementation of the extended CGO
- `./OntoUML`: folder containing OntoUML diagrams describing the domain behind XXXXXXXXXX.



Usage of the Prototype:

The prototype is desigend to simulate the functionality of the extended ontology using a Python script. The prototype uses the RDF library to take a set of raw data from the autonomous systems, and apply the new ontology mappings. The raw data is provided as .csv file and outputted as .ttl file, simulating the data-stream from robots to operating system through Callable webserver.
